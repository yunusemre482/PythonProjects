\subsubsection{Problem Definition }
\paragraph{In a typical 5-stage MIPS processor, if there is no forwarding, we need at least two instructions between two dependent instructions to prevent data hazards}

\subsubsection{Problem Solution }
\paragraph{To find all data hazard i create two class and ı put all information of instructions into IType class and RType class in order to solve this problem and ı divide them part by part such as type,rs,rt,rd and imm}
